# Description
During this lab, I had the opportunity to work through the GitHub Learning Lab course titled "Create a release based workflow." Here's a summary of what I accomplished and the main takeaways:

Firstly, I added the GitHub Learning Lab course to my GitHub account. I logged into my account and navigated to the course webpage. Then, I clicked on the "Start free course" button and specifically selected the "Begin Create a release based workflow" option. This step ensured that the course was cloned into my GitHub account, allowing me to work on it at my own pace.

In the lab, I learned that I could exit the course at any time and easily return to it later. By following the provided links, I could navigate back to my course repository or access the course from my GitHub account. This flexibility allowed me to manage my learning process effectively and pick up where I left off.

The majority of the lab focused on working through the course content itself. I clicked on the "Start: Create a beta release" button to begin the course and followed the step-by-step instructions provided. Although completing the entire course within the lab time was not expected, I aimed to progress at least up to step ten. This practical experience helped me gain insights into creating a release based workflow and familiarized me with the associated concepts and procedures.

Towards the end of the lab, I downloaded the completed course repository as a deliverable. I returned to the "Code" tab of the course repository in my GitHub account, clicked on the "Code" button, and selected "Download zip" to obtain a compressed file containing the finished course repository. I then renamed the downloaded zip file as "lab-09.zip" for submission purposes.

Reflecting on the lab, I found the GitHub Learning Lab course to be a valuable resource for self-directed learning. By engaging with the course material, following the guided steps, and exploring the concepts of release based workflows, I deepened my understanding of this essential aspect of software development.

Overall, this lab provided me with practical experience in accessing and working through a GitHub Learning Lab course. Through this hands-on approach, I learned about creating a release based workflow and gained familiarity with the related tools and procedures. These skills will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future software development endeavors, where version control and release management play vital roles.
